# SorryWereOpen
A super lightweight drop-in Swift class for checking a date is sat between two other dates.

# Usage
Drag and drop the Swift file into your project (somewhere neat like Supporting or something), then simply call the
class function to compare two dates from anywhere within your project, like so:

    SorryWereClosed.checkIfTime(todaysDate, isBetween: elevenInTheMorning, andTime: threeInTheAfternoon)
  
And that's it! Yup, dead simple.
